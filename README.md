### Running project

The project can be run by opening the solution and ensuring the SampleCart.API is selected as Startup project and running it.

You should be able to test the API through Swagger pages as well.

There are a few Unit test cases done using :
#####  Fluent Assertions / XUnit /Moq.

I have also broken down the application with different layers for 
#####  Data Access, Entity Models, and Service layer for Business logic.
